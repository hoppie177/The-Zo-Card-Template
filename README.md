# The-Zo-Card-Template
Template for the Zo Card

The Zo library, is a website idea I plan to bring to life. It's a simple website, something very easy to code and operate. My plan is to expand my languages and skills in the ones I know already. Forcing myself into a corner that will press me to really understand and use the languages I'm learning. I will use <strong>The Zo Library</strong> as my test subject. This card template is a part of the process. There will be duplicate cards that you will be able to scroll through. 

I learned the code and skills in order to achieve this effect from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGVXmoZWZuw">Tyler Potts</a> and his wonderful video. I plan on implenting this card into The Zo. 

Thank you for checking it out!
